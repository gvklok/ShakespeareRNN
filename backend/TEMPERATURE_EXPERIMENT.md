## Analysis

### Temperature 0.5 (Conservative)
- ✓ Most coherent and grammatically correct
- ✓ Stays on topic
- ✗ Repetitive patterns
- ✗ Less creative/interesting

### Temperature 1.0 (Balanced)
- ✓ Good balance of coherence and creativity
- ✓ Readable and interesting
- ✓ Recommended for most use cases

### Temperature 1.5-2.0 (Creative)
- ✓ Very creative and unexpected
- ✗ Less coherent
- ✗ More grammatical errors
- ✗ Can be nonsensical

## Conclusion

Temperature 1.0 provides the best balance for this model. Lower temperatures (0.5-0.7) work well for more conservative, coherent output. Higher temperatures (1.5+) are too random for this vocabulary size and produce incoherent results.

## Recommendation

For deployment: Use temperature 1.0 as default, allow users to adjust between 0.5-1.5 for their preference.
