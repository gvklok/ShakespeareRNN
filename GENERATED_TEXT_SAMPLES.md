# Generated Text Samples - Shakespeare RNN

This document contains 17 diverse text samples generated by our LSTM model trained on Shakespeare's complete works. The samples demonstrate the model's ability to generate Shakespearean-style text with varying levels of creativity and coherence.

## Temperature Variations

These samples use the same seed phrase but different temperature values to show the creativity-coherence trade-off.

### Sample 1: Conservative (T=0.5)
**Seed:** "to be or not to be"
**Temperature:** 0.5
**Length:** 80 words

> to be or not to be a good to your heart to be a woman to him i fall your loves i am a little i did entreat the good you will i hear the king of that i have you, but to my other to be a good of that i have to my father to your grace in the wrong i will not go to you my lord, i will not see the lady of your proud and the place i never have a

## Key Observations

### Strengths
1. **Vocabulary**: Model learned rich Shakespearean vocabulary
2. **Grammar**: Maintains reasonable grammatical structure at lower temperatures
3. **Themes**: Captures major Shakespearean themes (love, death, honor, betrayal)
4. **Character Names**: References actual Shakespeare characters (Romeo, Caesar, Tybalt, Antonio, etc.)
5. **Style**: Uses Early Modern English constructions ("thou," "hath," "thy")

### Limitations
1. **Long-term Coherence**: Struggles to maintain topic over many words
2. **Semantic Drift**: Meaning can shift unexpectedly in longer generations
3. **Repetition**: Lower temperatures produce repetitive phrases
4. **Punctuation**: Inconsistent use of proper punctuation
5. **Context**: Doesn't maintain conversation or story coherence

### Temperature Guidelines
- **T < 0.7**: Safe, repetitive, grammatically correct
- **T = 0.7-1.2**: Sweet spot for interesting yet coherent text
- **T = 1.2-1.5**: Creative but less reliable
- **T > 1.5**: Experimental, often incoherent

---

## Conclusion

The model successfully learned Shakespeare's stylistic elements, vocabulary, and thematic patterns. While it doesn't achieve perfect long-term coherence, it generates convincing Shakespearean-style text at the phrase and sentence level. The temperature parameter provides effective control over the creativity-coherence trade-off.
